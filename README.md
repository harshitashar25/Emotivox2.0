🎙️ AI Voice Cloning Model 🚀

This project focuses on building a high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Cloning system. Our implementation allows users to generate speech using a generic voice as well as clone their own voice for a personalized text-to-speech experience.

🔥 Features

✅ Generic Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts any text into speech using a high-quality, natural-sounding voice.
✅ Personalized Voice Cloning: Allows users to train the model on their voice and generate speech in their own tone.
✅ Interactive Interface: Users can input text, play, pause, and save audio.
✅ Realistic Speech Output: Ensures clarity and natural intonation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Generic TTS: Implemented using pyttsx3, a text-to-speech conversion library that works offline and supports multiple voices.
Voice Cloning: Powered by Coqui TTS, an open-source deep-learning framework for cloning voices and generating realistic speech.

📌 How It Works

1️⃣ Generic Text-to-Speech
Uses pyttsx3 to generate speech from text.

2️⃣ Personalized Voice Cloning
Users can upload a short voice sample.
The model learns the voice characteristics and generates speech using Coqui TTS.
Users can enter text and listen to their cloned voice read it out.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
