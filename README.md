🎙️ AI Voice Cloning Model 🚀

This project focuses on building a high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Cloning system. Our implementation allows users to generate speech using a generic voice as well as clone their own voice for a personalized text-to-speech experience.

🔥 Features

✅ Generic Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts any text into speech using a high-quality, natural-sounding voice.
✅ Personalized Voice Cloning: Allows users to train the model on their voice and generate speech in their own tone.
✅ Interactive Interface: Users can input text, play, pause, and save audio.
✅ Realistic Speech Output: Ensures clarity and natural intonation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Generic TTS: Implemented using pyttsx3, a text-to-speech conversion library that works offline and supports multiple voices.
Voice Cloning: Powered by Coqui TTS, an open-source deep-learning framework for cloning voices and generating realistic speech.

📌 How It Works

1️⃣ Generic Text-to-Speech
Uses pyttsx3 to generate speech from text.

2️⃣ Personalized Voice Cloning
Users can upload a short voice sample.
The model learns the voice characteristics and generates speech using Coqui TTS.
Users can enter text and listen to their cloned voice read it out.
